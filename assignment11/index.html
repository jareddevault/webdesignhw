        <p> <b>Overlanding</b> refers to self-reliant land travel by vehicle, typically to remote destinations. Overlanding vehicles can be cars, trucks, and even motorcycles. Most often pickup trucks and SUVs are utlilized and upfit to be off-road capable. In addition to being capable of traversing rough terrain, the vehicles are adapted to sustain the occupants. Drivers and passengers during overlanding trips live, eat, and sleep out of their vehicles. </p>
        <p>Overlanding for most people is a way to experience remote areas of wilderness, not readily accessible without a vehicle. Overlanding is certainly not viewed the same as backpacking, and receives criticism from some regarding the reliance on a vehicle. For most "overlanders" the vehicle is a large part of their interest. Outfitting your vehicle to help sustian you, and live comfortably in remote areas is a huge part of the draw. Overlanders are strong proponents of leave no trace, and will always stick to established trail systems.

        <p> While one in theory could overland in any vehicle, you should consider these themes when seeking to thrive. <b>Offroad capability</b> does not mean the capability to plow through protected wilderness, but instead referes to making a vehicle capable of rough terrain that is far from pavement. The seldom traveled trails often feature large rocks, water crossings, mud, and any combination of nature's obsticals. A vehicle with high ground clearance, grippy tires, and with four-wheel drive, is required for many of these trails.</p>
        <p>My personal favorite aspect of overlanding is cooking and eating in the outdoors. Many Overland vehicles are setup with complext <span id="kitchen"> <b>food preparation areas</b></span>.</p>
