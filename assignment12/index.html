    <h2>The Ollie</h2>
    <img class="boximages" src="images\ollie_2.png" alt="ollie_2">
    <p>The ollie is the very first trick a new skater should learn. An ollie is the basis for all flip tricks, and is necessary to jump over or onto obstacles. Even with a ramp, an ollie will make for a more controlled air. The ollie is simply a jump into the air, while "pulling" the board up with you. While in theory is a simple task, it is likely not going to be intuitive as you first learn to use your feet to manipulate the skateboard.</p>

    <h2>Foot Placement</h2>
    <img class="boximages" src="images\ollie_1.png" alt="ollie_1" float="left">
    <p>As with most things skateboarding, foot placement is key.You will likely find that you won't have to move your feet too far from where they normal are when cruising. The ball of your backfoot should be directly on the tail. Your front foot should be between the middle and just behind the bolts.Your front foot should be relatively perpendicular to the board. Your knees should be bent slightly, because you are preparing to jump!</p>

    <h2>The Pop</h2>
    <img class="boximages" src="images\ollie_3.png" alt="ollie_3">
    <p>You likely have already tried to just jump while on your board and found that you can certainly do so! However, your board likely stayed on the ground... <i>fun fact: this is actually a trick called a "hippy jump"</i> In order to get the board to follow us up into the air, we need to create some upward inertia. We do this by pushing down on the tail and lifting our front foot, most people call this the "pop". Now the tricky part is we have to pop the board while simultaneously jumping up. You should see that if you do just these steps, jumping and poping, the board starts to move up into the air with you!</p>

  <div class="box overflow-scroll">
    <h2>The Drag and Push</h2>
    <img class="boximages" src="images\ollie_4.png" alt="ollie_4">
    <p>Now with those last steps, we aren't quite to what we normall see ollies looking like. While both our body, and the board are now jumping up into the air, we don't seem to have much control. So to both gain control, and be able to ollie higher, we need our front foot to start doing some work. After we jump and pop, we need to thin about "dragging" our front foot "up" the board toward the nose. What this accomplishes for us is we continue to pull the board up with us, and we can start to level the board out with a slight "push" forward. <b>Don't forget to pull your back foot up so the board can keep moving with you!</b> If we think about each step, <i>pop, drag, push</i> we can look at how we use intertia to our advantage, and without intertia, we could never ollie! Thanks science!</p>
