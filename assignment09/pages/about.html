                <h2>Why did you choose this topic?</h2>
                <p>I have been a hobby cook and baker for several years. One of the first recipes I wanted to develop to specifically suit my tastes was chocolate chip cookies.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>Why should I listen to you?</h2>
                <p>I have very limited experience working in kitchens; however, I spend hours researching and trying recipes in my own time. My personal connection to food I feel was what makes the difference. And as a bonus, I didn't make you read my life story before the recipe!</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>Are there any other recipes I should check out for Chocolate Chip Cookies?</h2>
                <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPauR6tP_cg&list=WL&index=68&t=33s">Claire Saffitz</a> has one of the best cookie recipes I have ever tried, granted it is a bit more involved than mine.</p>
